 Our Dataset

For our first machine learning project, we are trying to predict the type of Iris flower, using some measurements of the flower. There are 3 types of Iris flowers we are considering in our dataset
1.	Iris Versicolor
2.	Iris Setosa
3.	Iris Virginica

Those are the ‘labels’ of our machine learning task.

This dataset was prepared by R. A. Fischer, way back in 1936! It doesn’t contain photos of flowers. Instead, it contains the following measurements of individual flowers:
1.	Sepal length
2.	Sepal width
3.	Petal length
4.	Petal width

Those are the attributes or features of our machine learning task. All measurements are in centimeters and the dataset contains such measurements for 150 flowers belonging to the above three subtypes of Iris. It’s one of the most popular datasets for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms.
